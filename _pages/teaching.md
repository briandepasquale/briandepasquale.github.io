======
### 2023-present, Biomedical Engineering, Boston University, Joint with Prof. [Mike Economo (BME)](https://www.bu.edu/eng/profile/michael-economo-ph-d/)

This course will cover the conceptual foundations of data science and introductory machine learning for biomedical engineers. This course serves as a foundational course in data analytics for BME Ph.D. students. It is designed to follow a graduate-level programming and linear algebra courses and will prepare students for graduate-level classes focusing on more advanced applications of machine learning and data science. This course, taught in Python, will cover the theory and practical applications of hypothesis testing, model fitting and parameter estimation, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning.
